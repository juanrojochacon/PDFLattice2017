The study of the PDFs of the proton is an active interdisciplinary research 
field lying at the crossroads of high-energy, hadronic and nuclear physics, 
with important applications in astroparticle physics.
%
In this white paper, we have reviewed our current knowledge of PDFs as
determined from both the global analysis framework
and from lattice-QCD computations. 
%
We have established a common language between the two communities, 
to facilitate interactions between them.
%
We have presented a first systematic comparison between state-of-the-art 
lattice-QCD calculations of PDF moments and the corresponding results from
global analyses both in the unpolarized and polarized cases.
%
Our results suggest that the improvement in accuracy and precision required 
in lattice-QCD calculations to match the first moments of PDFs 
determined from a global fit is larger in the unpolarized case than in the 
polarized.
%
We have provided additional benchmark numbers from the global fits 
for the higher moments not used in this benchmark comparison, which can be
used to validate future lattice-QCD calculations.

The main outcome of this white paper is the first
quantitative study of the impact of lattice-QCD calculations
in the global fits, based on both PDF moments and on Bjorken-$x$ dependence 
pseudo-data, assuming a number of different scenarios for
the associated uncertainties.
%
In the case of unpolarized PDFs, we have demonstrated that a reduction 
of the uncertainties of current lattice-QCD calculations is needed 
to provide any impact on global PDF fits.
%
In the case of polarized PDFs, we have shown that current lattice-QCD
calculations can provide useful input into global-PDF analyses.
%
Although the studies presented here are still in an initial exploratory phase, 
they provide strong motivation for global fitters to begin consider 
incorporating lattice-QCD constraints into their global analyses.

The studies presented in this white paper can be extended in a number of 
directions.

First, we have restricted our benchmark comparison only to the lowest moments 
of polarized and unpolarized PDFs, whose various sources of systematic 
uncertainties have been computed with the greatest control.
%
Future work should extend this comparison to higher PDF moments,
which will have some impact on PDF fits, provided the precision and accuracy
of lattice-QCD calculations keep improving.
%
More elaborate benchmarks could be performed, for instance on PDF moments
truncated from below to better take into account the fiducial $x$ region.
%
Appropriate benchmarks could also be devised to test lattice-QCD methods
that aim at the determination of the $x$ dependence of the PDFs.
%
We emphasize that modifications to the rating system adopted to
characterize  lattice-QCD calculations of PDF moments should require to 
be modified as lattice-QCD results will evolve.

Second, a similar benchmark exercise between global fit results and 
lattice-QCD calculations should be performed at the level of
$x$-space calculations.
%
It will be important to compare in detail the available lattice-QCD results 
with state-of-the-art global fits, to validate the former and
thereby demonstrate to what extent lattice-QCD calculations of $x$-space PDFs 
can contribute to global fits.

Third, it should be possible to assess the impact of lattice-QCD 
calculations on other nonperturbative objects
determined from global analyses of experimental data.
%
Examples of these include the transversity (see Ref.~\cite{Lin:2017stx}
for a recent study), transverse-momentum dependent 
PDFs (TMDs), generalized PDFs (GPDs) (see, 
{\it e.g.},~\cite{Angeles-Martinez:2015sea} and references therein), 
or collinear PDFs for hadrons other than 
protons~\cite{Sutton:1991ay,Burkardt:2001jg}.
%
All these quantities are known with much less precision than unpolarized
and polarized PDFs, given that the corresponding experimental information
is rather scarce. 
%
In this case, lattice-QCD calculations could have the potential
to provide new information, without the need of high precision.

In summary, the aim of this study has been to build a bridge between the 
lattice-QCD and global-fit communities.
%
Our final goal is for lattice-QCD calculations to provide novel inputs into 
polarized and unpolarized PDF fits. 
%
Precise lattice-QCD results could reduce the uncertainties of
global PDF fits and/or discriminate between different sets.
%
We hope this white paper motivates the lattice-QCD and global-fit
communities to continue fruitful interactions to improve our knowledge of PDFs.
