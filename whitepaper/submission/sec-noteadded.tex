\subsection*{Note added}

Following the completion of this work, we received some comments regarding the 
assessment criteria used in 
Tables~\ref{tab:unpolLQCDstatus1}-\ref{tab:polLQCDstatus1}. 
%
Although any such categorization system necessarily involves a certain amount 
of generalization, concerns have been expressed that the present criteria 
might in some instances yield instability under modest shifts in, for example, 
the selected range for the physical pion mass. 
%
In this respect, we stress that the rating system employed here represents a 
first step in broadly characterizing the vast range of calculations, and we 
expect forthcoming improvements including further investigation of the 
stability issues raised above.
