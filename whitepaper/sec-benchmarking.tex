\section{Benchmarks}

In this section we present updated benchmarks between the most
recent available lattice QCD calculations and global PDF fits,
both in terms of moments and of $x$-space PDFs by means of
quasi-PDFs.

\subsection{Moments}

Here we provide a systematic comparison between existing
lattice QCD results and PDF fitting calculations
for a number of moments both for unpolarized
and for polarized PDFs.

We provide both summary tables and overview comparison plots.

\subsubsection{Unpolarized parton distributions}


\subsubsection{Polarized parton distributions}

Next we repeat the same exercise, now for the moments
of polarized parton distributions.


\subsection{$x$-space dependent PDFs}

Next we present a number of benchmark comparisons for
PDFs at the level of their Bjorken-$x$
dependence.
