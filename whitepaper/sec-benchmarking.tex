\section{Benchmarks}

In this section we present updated benchmarks between the most
recent available lattice QCD calculations and global PDF fits,
both in terms of moments and of $x$-space PDFs by means of
quasi-PDFs.

\subsection{Moments}

Here we provide a systematic comparison between existing
lattice QCD results and PDF fitting calculations
for a number of moments both for unpolarized
and for polarized PDFs.
%
We provide both summary tables and overview comparison plots.

\subsubsection{Unpolarized parton distributions}

The moments that we will compare are the following:

\begin{itemize}

\item Second moment of $u^+-d^+$, defined as:
  \be
  \la x \ra_{u^+-d^+}\equiv \int_0^1 dx\,x\,\lc u(x,\mu)
  +\bar{u}(x,\mu)
-d(x,\mu) - \bar{d}(x,\mu) \, .
  \rc
  \ee

\item Third moment of $u^--d^-$, defined as:
  \be
  \la x^2 \ra_{u^--d^-}\equiv \int_0^1 dx\,x^2\,\lc u(x,\mu)
  -\bar{u}(x,\mu)
-d(x,\mu) + \bar{d}(x,\mu) \, .
  \rc
  \ee

  \end{itemize}

In all the cases, $\mu$ should be identified with the QCD
{\it factorization scale}, the scale that separates
long-distance from short-distance dynamics in perturbative
factorization.
%
Note that it is customary in PDF fits to assume
$\mu=\mu_F=\mu_R$, though in principle the two scales
could have different values.

\subsubsection{Polarized parton distributions}

Next we repeat the same exercise, now for the moments
of polarized parton distributions.


\subsection{$x$-space dependent PDFs}

Next we present a number of benchmark comparisons for
PDFs at the level of their Bjorken-$x$
dependence.
