\subsection{Hessian profiling}
\label{sec:hessianprofiling}

% Results of the Hessian profiling using HERAPDF2.0 as input.


Similarly to the reweighting method, that was used to estimate the effect of including Lattice
data to the Monte Carlo PDFs (NNPDF3.0) in Sec.\ref{}, in case of Hessian PDF sets a profiling
method~\cite{Paukkunen:2014zia,Camarda:2015zba} can be used.
In the following we have used the same Lattice data on moments to estimate the impact
on a HERAPDF20 unpolarized Hessian PDFs~\cite{Abramowicz:2015mha}. We choose HERAPDFs as a
representative set of Hessian PDFs. It has an additional advantage of using $\Delta\chi^2=1$ for
defining Hessian error PDFs which ensures a one to one correspondence of the profiling and
reweighting methods.
We have performed the study assuming the same 3 scenarios for the errors of the Lattice data,
see Table~\ref{tab:scenarios}. The study was performed using the xFitter program~\cite{Alekhin:2014irh}.

The central values of the considered moments are obtained using the central PDFs and the corresponding
errors are calculated in the following way:
\begin{equation}
\delta\mathcal{F}_i = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\sum_{k}\left(\mathcal{F}_i(f_k^+)-\mathcal{F}_i(f_k^-)\right)^2},
\quad i=1,\ldots,N_{\rm mom}
\end{equation}
where $k$ numbers the error PDFs.

The results of the profiling are shown in Table~\ref{tab:unpolmomentsProf} where the uncertainties
of the considered moments are displayed in case of initial HERAPDF20 and after including the Lattice
moments data in the three scenarios.

A few sentences about profiling -- that should probably go to the beginning of Sec.4\\

In case of Hessian PDF sets the Hessian profiling method~\cite{Paukkunen:2014zia}
can be used in order to both check the compatibility of new data on a given PDF set,
as well as to estimate the impact these data will have on the PDFs. In the following
we describe essential components of the profiling method. We will assume here that the
considered Hessian PDF set is using tolerance of $\Delta\chi^2=1$ which corresponds to
68\%CL uncertainties.

In the profiling method we consider a $\chi^2$ function in which the $\chi^2$ of the new
data has been added to the initial $\chi^2$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:newchi2}
\chi^2_{\text{new}} = \chi_0^2 + \sum_{k}^{N_{\text{eig}}} z_k^2
                    + \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\text{data}}}
                      \frac{\lp \mathcal{F}_i - \mathcal{F}_i^{\rm(exp)}\rp^2}
                           {\lp\delta\mathcal{F}_i^{\rm(exp)}\rp^2}
\end{equation}
where $\chi^2_0$ is the value of the $\chi^2$ function in the minimum of the initial PDF set,
$z_k$ are parameters diagonalizing the Hessian matrix of the initial PDF set,
$N_{\text{eig}}$ is the dimension of the space in which initial Hessian errors are defined
(half of the number of error PDFs), $\mathcal{F}_i^{\rm(exp)}$ is the new data,
and $\mathcal{F}_i$ the corresponding theory prediction.

In the spirit of the Hessian method the new theory predictions $\mathcal{F}_i$ can be expanded
using a linear approximation:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}_i \simeq \mathcal{F}_i[S_0] + \sum_k \frac{\partial\mathcal{F}_i[S]}{\partial z_k}\bigg|_{S=S_0} z_k
              \simeq \mathcal{F}_i[S_0] + \sum_k D_{ik} w_k,
\end{equation}
where $S_0$ represents central PDF and $D_{ik}=\frac{1}{2}(\mathcal{F}_i[S_k^+]-\mathcal{F}_i[S_k^-])$.
Additionally in the second equality derivative has been approximated by a finite difference between
Hessian PDF error sets $S_k^{\pm}$.
%
The new $\chi^2$ of Eq.~\eqref{eq:newchi2} can now be minimized with respect to the parameters $w_k$,
which results in:
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\vec{w}_{\text{{\bf min}}}} = \boldsymbol{-B^{-1}} \boldsymbol{\vec{a}},
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
B_{kn} &= \sum_i \frac{D_{ik}D_{in}}{\lp\delta\mathcal{F}_i^{\rm(exp)}\rp^2} + \delta_{kn},\\
a_k &= \sum_i \frac{D_{ik}(\mathcal{F}_i[S_0] - \mathcal{F}_i^{\rm(exp)})}{\lp\delta\mathcal{F}_i^{\rm(exp)}\rp^2}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The components of the solution $\boldsymbol{\vec{w}_{\text{{\bf min}}}}$ define a new set
of PDFs representing a global minimum after including the new data:
\begin{equation}
f_{\text{new}} = f_{S_0} + \sum_{k=1}^{N_{\text{eig}}} \frac{f_{S_k^+}-f_{S_k^-}}{2} w_k^{\text{min}}.
\end{equation}
At the same time $\boldsymbol{\vec{w}_{\text{{\bf min}}}}$ defines also a penalty term
\begin{equation}
P = \sum_{k=1}^{N_{\text{eig}}} \lp w_k^{\text{min}} \rp^2
\end{equation}
which can be used to estimate whether the new data is consistent with the initial set of PDFs;
$P\ll1$ means that the new data is consistent.

Finally, a set of new error PDFs can be also defined. In this case matrix $B$ plays a role of
the Hessian matrix allowing to follow a standard Hessian method to obtained PDF errors.
