\section{Theory overview}
\label{sec:theoryoverview}

In this first section of the white paper we present a succinct
summary of the theoretical background that underlies
first of all lattice QCD calculations of PDF-related
quantities, on the one hand, and global fits
of PDFs, on the other hand.
%
Special attention has been devoted to ensure a unified
consistent notation among the various parts of the whole section.

\subsection{Global PDF fits}

In this section we describe the theoretical and methodological framework that underpins global
determinations of parton distribution functions from hard-scattering data.
%
First we describe the general approach and its applications to unpolarized PDFs, and then
move to succinctly review the determination of polarized PDFs.
%
The discussion here is restricted to the essential information that is required to connect
with the lattice QCD discussion earlier in this document, more details about the
global PDF fitting framework can be found in the reviews of
Refs.~\cite{Ball:2012wy,Forte:2013wc,Rojo:2015acz,Butterworth:2015oua}.
