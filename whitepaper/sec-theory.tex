\section{Theory overview}
\label{sec:theoryoverview}

In this section we summarise the theoretical background that underlies
lattice-QCD calculations of PDF-related quantities, on the one hand, and 
global fits of PDFs, on the other hand.
%
We have devoted particular attention to ensuring a unified and
consistent notation among the various parts of the whole section,
in order to streamline the communication between the two communities.

We start with a brief review
of the basic concepts that define
unpolarised and polarised PDFs, and then
move on to
summarise the aspects of the lattice QCD framework
relevant for the calculations of PDFs. 
%
Further details of lattice QCD can be found, for example, in the
review in Ref.~\cite{Olive:2016xmw} and a complete
introduction is outlined in Ref.~\cite{Gupta:1997nd}. 
%
We complete this section by describing the theoretical and methodological 
framework that 
underpins global determinations of parton distribution functions from 
hard-scattering data, starting with the general approach and its applications 
to unpolarised PDFs, and then reviewing the determination of 
polarised PDFs.
%
This discussion is restricted to the
essential information required to connect
with lattice calculations,
see~\cite{Perez:2012um,DeRoeck:2011na,Alekhin:2011sk,Ball:2012wy,
Forte:2013wc,Jimenez-Delgado:2013sma,Rojo:2015acz,Butterworth:2015oua,
Accardi:2016ndt,Gao:2017yyd} for
more details about the global analysis approach.

Now we move to present the state-of-the-art of global
unpolarised and polarised PDF fits, with emphasis on those
aspects of these analyses which have direct relevance for
the subsequent comparison with the lattice QCD calculations
that will be presented in the next section.
