\section{Theory overview}
\label{sec:theoryoverview}

In this section we summarize the theoretical background that underlies
lattice-QCD calculations of PDF-related quantities, on the one hand, and 
phenomenological fits of PDFs, on the other hand.
%
We first review the general framework in which unpolarized and 
polarized PDFs are defined, then we present the available lattice-QCD 
and global-fit approaches to determine them. 
%
The discussion is restricted to the information required to connect the
lattice-QCD and global-fit methods.
%
We have devoted particular attention to ensuring a unified and
consistent notation between the two.
%
An extended treatment of the subjects discussed in this section
can be found in dedicated reviews.
%
We refer the interested reader to Refs.~\cite{Olive:2016xmw,Gupta:1997nd}
for lattice QCD and to Refs.~\cite{Perez:2012um,DeRoeck:2011na,Alekhin:2011sk,
Ball:2012wy,Forte:2013wc,Jimenez-Delgado:2013sma,Rojo:2015acz,
Butterworth:2015oua,Accardi:2016ndt,Gao:2017yyd} for global fits.
%
Details on the framework underlying PDFs can be found in general 
textbooks~\cite{Ellis:1991qj,Leader:2001gr,Collins:2011zzd,
DeGrand:2006zz,Gattringer:2010zz}.

%Now we move to present the state-of-the-art of global
%unpolarised and polarised PDF fits, with emphasis on those
%aspects of these analyses which have direct relevance for
%the subsequent comparison with the lattice QCD calculations
%that will be presented in the next section.
