\section{Theory overview}
\label{sec:theoryoverview}

In this first section of the white paper we present a succinct
summary of the theoretical background that underlies
lattice-QCD calculations of PDF-related
quantities, on the one hand, and global fits
of PDFs, on the other hand.
%
We have devoted particular attention to ensuring a unified and
consistent notation among the various parts of the whole section. We start with a brief
review of unpolarised and polarised PDFs and then summarize the aspects of lattice
QCD relevant to calculations of PDFs. Further details of lattice QCD can be found in
\cite{???}. We finish by describing the theoretical and methodological framework that underpins global
determinations of parton distribution functions from hard-scattering data, starting with
the general approach and its applications to unpolarized PDFs, and then
moving to succinctly review the determination of polarized PDFs.
%
The discussion of global fitting procedures is restricted to the essential information that is required to connect
with lattice calculations, more details about the
global PDF fitting framework can be found in the reviews of
Refs.~\cite{Ball:2012wy,Forte:2013wc,Rojo:2015acz,Butterworth:2015oua}.
