\label{sec:theoryoverview}

It is specially important that we make sure that we use a consistent
notation both in the lattice sections and in the global
PDF fitting versions.

\subsection{Lattice QCD}


\subsubsection{General intro to lattice QCD}


\subsubsection{PDF moments in lattice QCD}


\subsubsection{$x$-dependent calculations}

Where we review quasi-PDFs etc



\subsection{Global PDF fits}

Collinear unpolarized and polarized PDF analysis.
