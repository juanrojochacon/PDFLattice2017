The quark and gluon structure of the proton is a fascinating topic
at the cross-roads between high-energy and nuclear physics, with important
applications also for astroparticle physics.
%
Motivated by the recent breakthroughs in lattice QCD calculations of
PDF-related quantities, in particular PDF moments and their $x$-space
shape, this white paper presents a detailed snapshot of what we have learned so far
about the internal proton structure both from the global PDF fitting and from
the lattice QCD frameworks.
%
One of the main goals of this document is to clearly establish a common language
between the two communities, in order to facilitate the cross-talk between them,
and ensure that information can flow effortlessly between global PDF fitters
and lattice QCD practitioners.

Perhaps the main outcome of this initial effort is the first ever systematic
comparison between state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculations of PDF moments with
the corresponding results from the global PDF fits, both
for the unpolarized and for the polarized case.
%
Moreover, we have also presented numbers for higher moments, which can be used
in the future as reference to validate upcoming lattice calculations.

The studies presented in this white-paper can be extended in a number of directions.
%
First of all, here we have restricted our benchmark comparison only to the
first moment of polarized and unpolarized
PDFs.
%
Future work should extend this comparison to also the second and third moments,
as well as perhaps to include as well other non-perturbative objects
such as the transversity and transverse-momentum dependent PDFs.

x-space PDF comparisons, for different values of x

The ultimate goal of this efforts is to reach a situation where
lattice QCD calculations can be used to provide novel genuine inputs
to unpolarized and polarized PDF fits.
%
Here we have estimated .... using a number of assumptions ...
