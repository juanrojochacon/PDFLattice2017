QCD~\cite{Collins:2011zzd} is the non-abelian quantum field 
theory that describes the strong interaction.
%
It provides the theoretical foundation for the phenomenological ideas of 
quark model, colour charge, and partons as hadron constituents.
%
The power of QCD to describe physics from the pion mass scale all the way up 
to the scale of high-energy colliders, such as the LHC, relies on the 
remarkable properties of asymptotic freedom and 
factorisation~\cite{Gross:1973ju,Gross:1973id,Gross:1974cs,Politzer:1974fr}.

At high energies, or short distances, the QCD coupling is small 
and perturbation theory can accurately characterise the relevant scattering 
processes~\cite{Campbell:2006wx}.
%
At low energies, or larger distances, non-perturbative effects give rise to 
quark confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking~\cite{Gasser:1983yg}.
%
%The study of low-energy phenomena requires specific tools that go beyond 
%perturbation theory, that is, tools that can handle both strongly coupled 
%fields at long distances and the ultraviolet divergences of the theory at 
%short distances.
%
%The most representative of these tools is lattice QCD.
%
The connection between low- and high-energy dynamics is provided by QCD 
factorisation theorems~\cite{Collins:1989gx}: 
short-distance physics above the factorisation scale $\mu$ is captured by 
partonic hard-scattering cross sections calculated perturbatively as a 
power series expansion in the QCD coupling, while the 
long-distance physics below the factorisation scale $\mu$ is described by 
non-perturbative quantities.

In a collinear, leading-twist factorisation framework, these quantities are
universal PDFs.
%
Depending on the helicity state of the parent hadron, one usually 
distinguish between helicity-averaged (unpolarised, henceforth)
and helicity-dependent (polarised, henceforth) PDFs.

Unpolarised PDFs are denoted as 
\begin{equation}
f_{i}(x,\mu^2)\mbox{,} \ \ i=\{g,u,\bar{u},d,\bar{d},s,\bar{s},...\}
\,\mbox{,}
\label{eq:unpPDFs}
\end{equation}
where the index $i$ represents the parton flavour and $x$ is the fraction
of the hadron longitudinal momentum carried by the parton.
%
An additional index could be used to denote the hadronic species (proton,
neutron, pion, \dots).
%
However, we omit such a designation, as we only refer to the proton
in this paper.

At leading order (LO) in the QCD coupling series, unpolarised PDFs 
describe the probability distribution of a parton with a specified 
momentum fraction $x$.
%
The total momentum carried by each parton flavour is then given by 
the first moment of the corresponding PDF, for instance
%
\begin{align}
\int_{0}^{1}dx\ x\ \left[u(x,\mu^2)\right] 
= & {}  
\left\langle x\right\rangle _{u}(\mu^2)\,, \label{eq:umoment1}\\
\int_{0}^{1}dx\ x\ \left[u(x,\mu^2)+\bar{u}(x,\mu^2)\right] 
= & {} 
\left\langle x\right\rangle _{u^{+}}(\mu^2)\,. \label{eq:uplusmoment1}
\end{align}
%
Here, $\left\langle x\right\rangle _{u}$ is the momentum
carried by the up-quark, and $\left\langle x\right\rangle _{u^{+}}$ is
the momentum carried by the sum of up and anti-up quarks.
%
We are especially careful with the notation, as we always refer to $q^+$ to 
indicate the sum of the quark and anti-quark PDFs of the same flavour (see
Appendix~\ref{app:notation} for our notational conventions).

Polarised PDFs describe the extent to which quarks and gluons 
with a given momentum fraction $x$ have their spins aligned with the spin 
direction of a fast moving nucleon in a helicity eigenstate. 
%
They are denoted as 
\begin{equation}
\Delta f_i(x,\mu^2) \equiv f_i^{\uparrow}(x,\mu^2) - f_i^{\downarrow}(x,\mu^2)
\mbox{,} \ \ i=\{g,u,\bar{u},d,\bar{d},s,\bar{s},...\}
\,\mbox{,}
\label{eq:polPDFs}
\end{equation}
where the index $i$ represents the parton flavour, $x$ is the fractional 
momentum carried by the parton, as in Eq.~\eqref{eq:unpPDFs},  
and the parton's spin alignement along ($\uparrow$) or opposite 
($\downarrow$) the polarisation direction of its parent nucleon
is made explicit.

Much of the interest in the polarised PDFs is related to the fact that 
their first moments can be interpreted as the fractions of the proton's 
spin carried by the corresponding partons.
%
They are therefore the key to one of the most fundamental, 
but not yet satisfactorily answered questions in hadronic physics,
{\it i.e.}, how the spin of the proton is distributed among its constituents.
%
Specifically, the first moments of the singlet and the gluon polarised PDFs,
\begin{align}
\Delta\Sigma(\mu^2)
& =
\sum_{q}^{n_f}\int_0^1 dx 
\left[\Delta q(x, \mu^2) + \Delta\bar{q}(x, \mu^2)\right]
\equiv
\sum_q^{n_f}\langle 1 \rangle_{\Delta q^+}(\mu^2)\,,
\\
\Delta G(\mu^2)
& =
\int_0^1 dx \Delta g(x,\mu^2)
\equiv
\langle 1 \rangle_{\Delta g}(\mu^2)
\,,
\label{eq:moments}
\end{align}
directly contribute to the proton spin sum rule~\cite{Leader:2013jra}.

Note that for both unpolarised and polarised PDFs the value of the 
renormalisation scale $\mu$ is usually chosen to be equal to the characteristic 
scale $Q$ of the hard scattering process involving the PDFs.
%
Beyond leading order, PDFs are renormalisation scheme-dependent 
quantities, typically worked out in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme.
%
When PDFs are convoluted with the appropriate partonic hard-scattering 
cross sections, computed in the same scheme, the corresponding physical 
observables are scheme-independent, up to subleading terms in the perturbative 
expansion. 

Both unpolarised and polarised PDFs are accessible, theoretically and 
experimentally, through the Compton scattering amplitude
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Compton}
T_{\mu\nu}(p,q) 
= 
\int {\rm d}^4\!x\, {\rm e}^{iqx}  \langle p,s |T J_\mu(x) J_\nu(0)|p,s\rangle\, ,
\end{equation}
at large virtual photon momenta $q^2=-Q^2$. 
%
Here $T$ is the time-ordering operator, $J_\mu(x)$ and $J_\nu(0)$ are local 
vector bilinears at space-time points $x$ and $0$ respectively, and the 
external states are hadronic states with momentum $p$ and spin $s$.

For instance, in the case of Deep-Inelastic Scattering (DIS) of a 
polarised lepton beam off a polarised nucleon target, the 
most general form of the Compton amplitude $T_{\mu\nu}(p,q)$ reads
\begin{align}
T_{\mu\nu}(p,q) 
= {} & 
  \left(\delta_{\mu\nu}-\frac{q_\mu q_\nu}{q^2}\right)\mathcal{F}_1(\omega,Q^2) 
+ \left(p_\mu-\frac{p\cdot q}{q^2}q_\mu\right) \left(p_\nu-\frac{p\cdot q}{q^2}q_\nu\right) \frac{1}{p\cdot q} \mathcal{F}_2(\omega,Q^2)\,,\\ 
& {} \quad  
+ \epsilon_{\mu\nu\lambda\sigma}q_\lambda s_\sigma \frac{1}{p\cdot q}\mathcal{G}_1(\omega,Q^2)
+ \epsilon_{\mu\nu\lambda\sigma}q_\lambda \left(p\cdot q s_\sigma - s\cdot q p_\sigma\right) \frac{1}{(p\cdot q)^2}\mathcal{G}_2(\omega,Q^2)\,.
\end{align}
%
The imaginary parts of the Compton amplitude structure functions, 
$\mathcal{F}_1$, $\mathcal{F}_2$, $\mathcal{G}_1$ and $\mathcal{G}_2$, 
are related to the usual structure functions of the hadronic tensor, 
$F_1(x,Q^2)$, $F_2(x,Q^2)$, $g_1(x,Q^2)$ and $g_2(x,Q^2)$, 
through the optical theorem.
%
The unpolarised and polarised PDFs can be derived from $\mathcal{F}_1$ and 
$\mathcal{G}_1$ by first rewriting them in terms of the spin-independent 
and spin-dependent structure functions, $F_1(x,Q^2)$ and $g_1(x,Q^2)$.
%
Neglecting target mass corrections, one has, defining $\omega=2p\cdot q/q^2$,
\begin{align}
\mathcal{F}_1(\omega,Q^2) 
= {} & 4 \omega^2 \int_0^1 dx\,  \frac{xF_1(x,Q^2)}{1-(\omega x)^2} 
= \sum_{n=2,4,\cdots}^\infty 4\omega^n \int_0^1 dx\, x^{n-1} F_1(x,Q^2) \,, \\
\mathcal{G}_1(\omega,Q^2) 
= {} & 4 \omega \int_0^1 dx\, \frac{g_1(x,Q^2)}{1-(\omega x)^2} 
= \sum_{n=1,3,\cdots}^\infty 4\omega^n \int_0^1 dx\, x^{n-1} g_1(x,Q^2)\,.
\end{align}
%
%Odd moments may be obtained from the mixture of currents $J_\mu J_\nu^5$.

At a sufficiently high momentum transfer, power corrections can be neglected and
QCD factorisation allows us to write the structure functions 
$F_1(x,Q^2)$ and $g_1(x,Q^2)$ as a convolution between perturbatively-computable
hard-scattering cross-sections and non-perturbative parton distributions:
\begin{align}
F_1(x,Q^2) 
= {} 
& x\sum_i^{n_f} \int_x^1 \frac{{\rm d}z}{z}\,C_{1,i}\left(\frac{x}{z},\alpha_s(Q^2)\right)f_i(z,Q^2) \,, \label{eq:Fi}\\
g_1(x,Q^2) 
= {} 
& \sum_i^{n_f} \int_x^1\frac{dy}{y}\, \Delta C_{1,i}\left(\frac{x}{z},\alpha_s(Q^2)\right) \Delta f_i(z,Q^2) \,.
\label{pdf}
\end{align}
%
Here $x=Q^2/2p\cdot q$ is the Bjorken variable identified with the parton
fractional momentum, $n_f$ denotes the number of active
flavours at the scale $Q^2$ (including the gluon), $C_{1,i}$ and 
$\Delta C_{1,i}$ are the perturbative partonic hard-scattering cross sections,
$\alpha_s$ is the QCD strong coupling, and $f_i(x,Q^2)$ and $\Delta f_i(x,Q^2)$ 
are the unpolarised and polarised PDFs.

While PDFs cannot be calculated perturbatively, their dependence on the scale 
$\mu$ resulting from factorisation can be.
%
This is done by means of the
DGLAP (Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi) 
evolution equations~\cite{Dokshitzer:1977sg,Gribov:1972ri,Altarelli:1977zs},
a set of integro-differential coupled equations of the form
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dglap}
\frac{\partial (\Delta)f_i(x,\mu^2)}{\partial \ln \mu^2}
=
\sum_{j=g,q,\bar{q}}\int_x^1 
\frac{{\rm d}z}{z}(\Delta)P_{ij}(x/z)(\Delta)f_j(z,\mu^2)\, .
\end{equation}
%
In short, the logarithmic derivative of the PDF is determined by a convolution
of the PDFs with the DGLAP kernels $(\Delta)P_{ij}$, which can be in turn 
computed perturbatively in powers of $\alpha_{s}$.
%
The unpolarised splitting functions $P_{ij}$ are currently completely known up  
to NNLO~\cite{mvvns,Vogt:2004mw} in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ 
renormalisation scheme.
%
Results for the unpolarised non-singlet splitting functions have appeared 
recently at N$^3$LO~\cite{Davies:2016jie,Moch:2017uml}.
%
The polarised splitting functions $\Delta P_{ij}$ are currently known up to  
NNLO~\cite{Moch:2014sna} in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ renormalisation scheme.
%
The DGLAP evolution equations can be solved numerically using
either $x$-space or Mellin $N$-space techniques widely available in various
public codes~\cite{Vogt:2004ns,Salam:2008qg,Botje:2010ay,
Bertone:2013vaa,Bertone:2015cwa}.
%
The typical level of agreement for the results of the PDF evolution 
has been demonstrated to be of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$.

The power series expansion of both the unpolarised and polarised 
splitting functions contains terms proportional to $\ln\mu^2$, 
$\ln(1/x)$ and $\ln(1-x)$.
%
While DGLAP evolution sums power of $\alpha_s\ln\mu^2$ contributions,
in the small-$x$ kinematic region one may also sum power of $\ln(1/x)$
contributions, independent of the value of $\mu^2$.
%
This is achieved by the BFKL (Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov) equations,
which resum $\ln(1/x)$ terms to all orders.
%
They were originally formulated in the unpolarised case at leading logarithm 
(LL) order~\cite{Fadin:1975cb,Kuraev:1976ge,Kuraev:1977fs,Balitsky:1978ic},
and later extended to next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) 
order~\cite{Fadin:1998py,Camici:1997ij,Ciafaloni:1998gs}
%
The DGLAP and BFKL frameworks can be matched into a single set of evolution 
equations by means of the small-$x$ resummation
formalism~\cite{Ciafaloni:1999yw,Ciafaloni:2000cb,Ciafaloni:2003ek,
Ciafaloni:2003rd,Altarelli:2005ni,White:2006yh,Altarelli:2008aj,
Ciafaloni:2007gf,Bonvini:2016wki}.

In the polarised case, the use of the small-$x$ formalism was pioneered 
decades ago by Kirschner and Lipatov~\cite{Kirschner:1983di} 
(see also~\cite{Kirschner:1994rq,Kirschner:1994vc,Griffiths:1999dj}) 
and later by Bartels, Ermolaev, and Ryskin in the context of the structure 
function $g_1$~\cite{Bartels:1995iu,Bartels:1996wc}.
%
Small-$x$ evolution equations which resum powers of $\alpha_s\ln^2(1/x)$ 
in the polarisation-dependent evolution along with powers of $\alpha_s\ln(1/x)$
in the unpolarised evolution have been recently reconsidered using the 
formalism of Wilson line-like operators~\cite{Kovchegov:2015pbl}.
%
Both numerical~\cite{Kovchegov:2016weo}
and analytical~\cite{Kovchegov:2016zex,Kovchegov:2017jxc}
solutions to these small-$x$ evolution equations have been derived
for the flavour singlet combination of polarised PDFs.
%
Results have been extended also to the case of the polarised gluon 
PDF~\cite{Kovchegov:2017lsr}.
