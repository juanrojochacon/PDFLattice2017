\subsection{Discussion}

We conclude this section with a brief discussion of the main lessons that
can be learned from this exercise, which provides the first quantitative estimate
of the impact of present and future lattice-QCD calculations of PDF moments
and $x$-space PDFs, for both polarised and unpolarised PDFs.

First, we have demonstrated that in the polarised case,
even with current uncertainties, lattice-QCD calculations of
selected PDF moments can impose sizable constraints on several
important polarised quark combinations.
%
This suggests that global polarised PDF analyses should consider
including existing lattice-QCD calculations in their fits to constrain some
of the least known quark combinations, such as the total strangeness.
%
The situation is rather different in the unpolarised case,
where a reduction of the current lattice-QCD uncertainties by a factor of between five 
and ten seems to be required to influence global fits.
%
This difference arises because unpolarised PDFs are known with much higher precision than polarised
PDFs, thanks to the much wider amount of experimental data sensitive to unpolarised PDFs,
including the constraints from recent high-precision measurements at the
LHC.
%
Thus, in addition to the differences highlighted  in Fig.~\ref{fig:Bmomsunp},
much more precise lattice-QCD calculations than in the polarised case 
need to be used to be competitive with current PDF fits.


Second, lattice-QCD calculations of the quark isotriplet combinations
$xu-xd$ and $x\bar{u}-x\bar{d}$ would be instrumental in constraining
quark PDFs at large-$x$.
%
Even a calculation with $\delta_L\simeq 10\%$ uncertainties at large-$x$ would
start to provide useful constraints on global fits.
%
Moreover, we find that, in the unpolarised case, the information on the
PDFs that could be derived from a direct $x$-space calculation
from lattice-QCD is clearly superior to the information that can be obtained
from PDF moments alone, at least for the subset of PDFs and moments used in the present
exercise.

The profiling studies presented in this section could be extended in
a number of directions.
%
In the polarised case, one could include the current lattice-QCD
values of the moments listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:BMpol} in global analyses: 
indeed, we have demonstrated that at the current level of uncertainties one 
expects to find some non-trivial constraints.
%
In this respect, a crucial topic to investigate is the compatibility 
(or lack thereof) of the existing lattice-QCD numbers compared to constraints 
from experimental data.
%
For both unpolarised and polarised PDFs, it would be interesting to include the 
effects of other moments and flavour combinations.
%
Higher moments, in particular, typically probe regions of higher $x$, compared
to lower moments, and in the large-$x$ regions uncertainties in the phenomenological PDFs are
more marked.
%
One could also consider the effects of the quark combinations for which $x$-space
calculations might be available, for example those related to the proton strangeness.
%
Finally, a more refined analysis should include the theoretical correlations
expected in lattice-QCD calculations, for instance, in the case of $x$-space calculations,
one expects neighbouring points in $x$ to be highly correlated.
