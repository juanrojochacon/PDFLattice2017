\section{Improving PDF fits with lattice QCD calculations}
\label{sec:projections}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section, we provide an estimate of the potential
impact of future lattice-QCD calculations
in global unpolarized and polarized PDF fits.
%
This study is carried out with two publicly available
tools: the Bayesian reweighting
method~\cite{Ball:2011gg,Ball:2010gb} applied to the
NNPDF3.1~\cite{Ball:2017nwa} and NNPDFpol1.1~\cite{Nocera:2014gqa} sets; 
and the Hessian profiling method~\cite{Camarda:2015zba} applied to
HERAPDF2.0 set~\cite{Abramowicz:2015mha}.
%
Both methods allow us to quantify the impact of new measurements
(or of future measurements, if pseudo-data are used) on PDFs without
repeating the global analysis.
%
The main limitation of these methods is that they are maximally reliable
if the amount of information carried in by the new (pseudo-)data is moderate
in comparison to that already included in the fit.

For simplicity, we limit our study to the impact of a subset of the moments 
that can be computed using lattice QCD, focusing on those that can be 
currently calculated with the highest precision.
%
Therefore, we restrict ourselves to the benchmark moments discussed in 
Sect.~\ref{sec:benchmarking}.
%
We also consider pseudo-data based on $x$-space
lattice-QCD calculations from the quasi-PDF approach
discussed in Sect.~\ref{sec:xdependence}.
%
As we show, particularly in the unpolarized case, the
constraining power of direct $x$-space calculations is
superior to that of PDF moments.

\subsection{Impact of lattice calculations of PDF moments}

We start by quantifying the constraining power of projected lattice-QCD 
calculations of PDF moments on both unpolarized and polarized global fits.
%
We define the settings for our study and present our results following
Bayesian reweighting and Hessian profiling, respectively.
