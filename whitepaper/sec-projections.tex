\section{Improving PDF fits with lattice QCD calculations}
\label{sec:projections}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section we aim to provide an initial estimate of the potential
impact of present and future lattice-QCD calculations
in global unpolarised and polarised PDF fits.
%
This study will be carried out by means of two publicly available
tools: the
Bayesian reweighting
method~\cite{Ball:2011gg,Ball:2010gb} applied to the
NNPDF3.1 and NNPDFpol1.1 sets and the Hessian
profiling method~\cite{Camarda:2015zba} applied to
HERAPDF2.0~\cite{Abramowicz:2015mha}.
%
Both approximate methods allow to quantify the impact of new measurements
(or of future measurements, if pseudo-data is used) on a PDF set without
having to repeat the global analysis.
%
The main limitation of these methods is that they are only reliable
in those cases for which the impact of the new (pseudo-)data
is not too strong.

For simplicity, we will restrict  ourselves here to study the
impact of a subset of the moments that can be
evaluated using lattice QCD.
%
In particular,
we will focus on those that can be currently calculated
with the smallest uncertainties, as discussed in
Sect.~\ref{sec:benchmarking}.
%
We do not consider here
the rest of the PDF moments discussed in
Sect.~\ref{Sec:IntroLQCD} and Appendix~\ref{sec:LQCDtables},
since these are typically affected by larger systematic uncertainties.
%
In addition, we
will also consider in this exercise pseudo-data based on $x$-space
lattice QCD calculations, such as those from the quasi-PDF approach
discussed in Sect.~\ref{sec:xdependence}.
%
As we will show, specially in the unpolarized case, the
constraining power of direct $x$-space calculations is
superior to that of the PDF moments.
