\section{Improving PDF fits with lattice calculations}
\label{sec:projections}

In this section we quantify the impact of future lattice QCD calculations
in global unpolarized and polarized PDF fits.
%
We use two types of publicly available tools to quantify this
impact: for Monte Carlo sets, the Bayesian Reweighting
method~\cite{Ball:2011gg,Ball:2010gb} and for Hessian sets,
the hessian Profiling method.
%
We consider various assumptions, from pessimistic to optimistic,
and then attempt to study what would be the PDF uncertainty
reduction in number of phenomenologically
important cross-sections for unpolarized processes at the
LHC and for polarized processes at the LHC.
%
In the case of the LHC, potentially important processes include
high-mass BSM particle production, Higgs cross-sections and
the $W$ mass measurement.
